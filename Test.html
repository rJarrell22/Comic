				<p class="hs-john-auto">i got a little monsters poster, it's so awesome. i'm going to watch it again today, the applejuice scene was so funny.</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto">oh hell that is such a coincidence i just found an unopened container of apple juice in my closet it is like fucking christmas up in here</p>
				<p class="hs-john-auto">ok thats fine, but i just have one question and then a word of caution. have you ever seen a movie called little monsters starring howie mandel and fred savage?</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto">but</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto">the seal is on</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto">are you suggesting someone put piss in my apple juice at the factory</p>
				<p class="hs-john-auto">all im saying is don't you think monster howie mandel has the power to do something as simple as reseal a bottle?</p>
				<p class="hs-john-auto">try using your brain numbnuts.</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto">why did the fat kid or whoever drank it know what piss tasted like</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto">i mean his reaction was nigh instantaneous</p>
				<p class="hs-john-auto">it was that 15th day in a row howie mandel peed in is juice.</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto">ok i can accept that</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto">monster B-list celebrity douchebags are cunning and persistent pranksters</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto">also fred savage has a really punchable face</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto">but who cares about this let's stop talking about it</p>

				<p class="hs-john-auto">my dad has the main and i guess i have to go get it from him and see if it's there.</p>
				<p class="hs-john-auto">and i've been busy spending all afternoon shitting around with my stupid sylladex.</p>
				<p class="hs-john-auto">it's so frustrating.</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto">whats your modus</p>
				<p class="hs-john-auto">what?</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto">how do you retrieve artifacts from it</p>
				<p class="hs-john-auto">oh. like one at a time i guess. and if i put too much in, something falls out.</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto">stack? hahahahahaha</p>
				<p class="hs-john-auto">what is yours?</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto">hash map</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto">my bro taught me a few tricks he basically knows everything and is awesome</p>
				<p class="hs-john-auto">what the hell is that?</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto">you should probably brush up on your data structures</p>
				<p class="hs-john-auto">i guess.</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto">did you at least allocate your strife specibus</p>
				<p class="hs-john-auto">no.</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto">it could free up a card for you</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto">plus let you attack stuff whenever things get too hot to handle</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto">which is never</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto">what have you got</p>
				<p class="hs-john-auto">well, i've got a hammer but it's trapped under some arms.</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto">wow you really suck at this dont you</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto">just get rid of the arms and then allocate the hammer to the specibus</p>
				<p class="hs-john-auto">how?</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto hs-clear-below">i dont know just use the arms on any old thing and see if it works</p>
				<p class="hs-john-auto">ok, i did it.</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto">hammerkind?</p>
				<p class="hs-john-auto">yeah.</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto">ok that will be the permanent allocation for your specibus</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto">i guess i should have mentioned that</p>
				<p class="hs-john-auto">uh...</p>
				<p class="hs-dave-auto">hope you like hammers dude!</p>
				<p class="hs-john-auto">yes, that's fine i guess. i can't imagine it's going to be all that relevant.</p>
