It's flawlessly polished. Sometimes you feel proud of your dad for how well he takes care of the house. </h4>

			<h4 style = "max-width: 600px; margin: auto;"> Though sometimes he is a bit of a hard person to deal with. If he were to notice you he'd engage in some fatherly antics and you may never break free. You may have to engage in a STRIFE with him. If so then you'll deal with it unarmed. Maybe a couple YOUTH ROLLS and an ABSCOND will help you out. </h4>

			<h4 style = "max-width: 600px; margin: auto;"> As you reach the bottom of the stairs your PHONE buzzes in your pocket. Your friend REDEYED OBSERVER has come back from their business. You're glad you installed Pesterchum on your mobile device. Thank god for technology. </h4>
