			<h4 style = "max-width: 600px; margin: auto; padding-top:50px;"> You decided it was high time you left your neat room and exit out into your hallway. Where it is not as neat. The wallpaper is old fashioned, a testamet to your FATHER's INTERESTS. </h4><br>
			<h4 style = "max-width: 600px; margin: auto;"> Your Dad is highly interested in the old fashioned. Antique LAMPS and old wallpaper line the hallway. Along with black and white PAINTINGS of HISTORIC CELEBRITIES. When you turn the corner a painting of Frank Sinatra stares you dead in the eyes. Don't look at me like that Frank I'm not interested in flying away with you to the moon, nor playing amongst the stars. </h4><br>
			<h4 style = "max-width: 600px; margin: auto;"> You don't really know the real reason as to why your dad likes this stuff. Maybe he just envies the generation before his. You tend to think he's just an absolute weirdo. Nonetheless he's your father so you don't question it to much. He likes to tell you about old stories from his childhood that you do genuinley enjoy. So there's that. </p>
