				<p class = "hs-mary-auto"> Heyo! What is up my man  </p>
				<p class = "hs-mary-auto"> my dude </p>
				<p class = "hs-mary-auto"> my homeslice breadslice dawg </p>
				<p class = "hs-mary-auto"> lol </p>
				<p class = "hs-mary-auto"> so how u doin my guy? </p>
				<p class = "hs-jack-auto"> Whatever it is you need help with I'm not doing it. 
											Unless you're here to wish me a Happy Birthday.
											Then thank you I appreciate it.
				</p>
				<p class = "hs-mary-auto"> Damn bro at least gimme a chance to say it first ._.  </p>
				<p class = "hs-mary-auto"> speaking of which, happy bday! </p>
				<p class = "hs-jack-auto"> Thank you I appreciate it. 
											I am one year closer to death though I have been given money and a poster so I will take it.
				</p>
				<p class = "hs-jack-auto"> Now what did you need? I hope you're not asking me about your homework or some stupid favor. </p>
				<p class = "hs-mary-auto"> well damn shaty ok </p>
				<p class = "hs-mary-auto"> shawty* </p>
				<p class = "hs-mary-auto"> well, if you insist, I recently copped myself a brand new sylladex </p>
				<p class = "hs-mary-auto"> That new controller one from gamebro issue#413 </p>
				<p class = "hs-mary-auto"> got any tips'n'tricks? </p>
				<p class = "hs-jack-auto"> That stupid controller one where you have to put in fighting combos?
											I hate to be rude but it looked very impracticle and low functional use.
											I'm suprised you didn't try and find an array modus. It's the easiest one to use.
											Not even queue or stack. The more simple ones.
				</p>
				<p class = "hs-mary-auto"> DAM BRO </p>
				<p class = "hs-mary-auto"> didn't have to do me like that come on </p>
				<p class = "hs-mary-auto"> disregarding the insult to my intellect (fancy words go brr) </p>
				<p class = "hs-mary-auto"> the basic modi suck lmao, boring af </p>
				<p class = "hs-mary-auto"> SPEAKING OF WHICH </p>
				<p class = "hs-mary-auto"> you are in no place to criticize my choice of modus </p>
				<p class = "hs-mary-auto"> mr hashmap user </p>
				<p class = "hs-jack-auto"> Don't insult <b> MY </b> use of sylladex. At least it requires a higher level of thinking.
											You should probably just brush up on your data structures.
				</p>
				<p class = "hs-mary-auto"> oh wow didn't realize id be getting a visit from the nefarious doctor IQ himself today </p>
				<p class = "hs-mary-auto"> at least my controller modus is actually fun lol </p>
				<p class = "hs-jack-auto"> I prefer fuctionality over fun. Anyway enough with this banter what did you need?
											I assume you weren't just going to talk with me about my sylladex?
				</p>
				<p class = "hs-jack-auto"> Oh now that I'm thinking about it. Did you ever allocate your strife specibus.
											You mentioned before that you've had it empty for a while.
				</p>
				<p class = "hs-mary-auto"> yeah actually, i dug my blowgun out of the closet and allocated that </p>
				<p class = "hs-mary-auto"> also a backscratcher apparently? </p>
				<p class = "hs-mary-auto"> but i think i left it for so long that i also got the fist one </p>
				<p class = "hs-mary-auto"> O shi </p>
