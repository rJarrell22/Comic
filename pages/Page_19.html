				<p class = "hs-jack-auto"> Sure whatever. I'm down for it. If the others have agreed then I'll join in. I know you all would get stuck otherwise. </p>
				<p class = "hs-jack-auto"> I just need to grab my copy from downstairs and pray that he doesn't engage in antics. </p>
				<p class = "hs-mary-auto"> they do be quite some antics </p>
				<p class = "hs-jack-auto"> Alright I'll be back up in my room later. Tell the other two that it's my birthday by the way I think they forgot cause I haven't heard from them. </p>
