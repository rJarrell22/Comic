				<p class = "hs-jack-auto"> Well you're new. I know one or two of the others in your little onterage but you're new. So what brought you here? Bored with my other friends or did my regulars not want to talk to me today? </p>
				<p class = "hs-jyrago-auto"> Man y0u really are a smartass and an assh0le. I th0ught they were kidding 0r s0methin.  </p>
				<p class = "hs-jack-auto"> Everyone is an asshole in their own unique way. There's always some way shape or form that they are dislikeable. </p>
				<p class = "hs-jack-auto"> Also what is with those stupid like, what would you even call those, typing quirks? Habits? Like what are those? Constantly replacing your o's with zeroes. It's just kinda stupid. </p>
				<p class = "hs-jyrago-auto"> Yes it's a typing quirk, and n0 they aren't stupid every0ne does it. Where's yours? </p>
				<p class = "hs-jyrago-auto"> 0 wait. I f0rg0t y0u guys are humans. Y0u d0n't have typing quirks. </p>
				<p class = "hs-jyrago-auto"> Y0u guys are weird. </p>
				<p class = "hs-jack-auto"> More of this alien shit? I really don't understand you guys. You're humans just like us. There's no point in faking anything. Your whole little group bothers us everyday and the one thing you all agree on is WE'RE the aliens and you aren't? You're humans but clearly pretty damn sad ones at that. </p><br>

				<p class = "hs-jack-auto"> The fuck was that? Did you just use a chat command to face palm? Alright I'm sick of this shit. You all weirdos can troll teenagers on the internet all you want. Just know you're sad and pathetic. </p><br>
